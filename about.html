            Hello! I’m Podeti Harshavardhan, a passionate and driven Computer Science Engineering student currently in my third year at the Institute of Aeronautical Engineering, Hyderabad. With a strong foundation in web development, I enjoy creating impactful digital experiences and am always eager to take on new challenges. I have hands-on experience in building responsive and user-friendly websites, and I actively refine my skills by practicing coding on popular platforms, where I continuously push my knowledge and abilities further. I’m excited to connect, learn, and grow in the tech industry as I work toward a future where I can innovate and contribute meaningfully to the field.
